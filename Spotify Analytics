# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

#Next, I explored the data using the following SQL. 


SELECT * FROM SPOTIFYDATA;

-- #1 Who are the TOP 10 artists ?

SELECT ARTIST_NAME,POPULARITY
FROM SPOTIFYDATA
GROUP BY POPULARITY
ORDER BY POPULARITY DESC
LIMIT 10 ; 

--#2 How many songs each artst have in the TOP 50?

SELECT ARTIST_NAME, COUNT(ARTIST_NAME) AS SONGS_IN_TOP_50
FROM SPOTIFYDATA
GROUP BY ARTIST_NAME
ORDER BY SONGS_IN_TOP_50 DESC;

-- #3 What song has the fastest tempo ?

SELECT TRACK_NAME,MAX(TEMPO)
FROM SPOTIFYDATA;

--#4.  What artistS Longest song?

SELECT ARTIST_NAME, MAX(DURATION_MS) AS TIME
FROM SPOTIFYDATA
GROUP BY ARTIST_NAME;
